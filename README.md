## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how decentralized and centralized finance can interact.

Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of how an **Ethereum DApp Store** (a hypothetical platform for discovering and using decentralized applications) would integrate with major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

First, a crucial clarification: A true "DApp Store" on Ethereum would primarily host decentralized applications that interact with blockchain protocols directly. Direct integration with the internal, private order books of a CEX is not possible because those are off-chain, proprietary systems.
